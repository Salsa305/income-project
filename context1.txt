That is a very insightful question. The short answer is: **No, you should ideally apply this concept to all models you are reporting on, especially the Logistic Regression (baseline) and SVM models, in addition to XGBoost.**

Here is the breakdown of why and how to update your notebooks to fully satisfy your professor's requirement:

## Why You Need to Report Threshold-Dependent Results for All Models

Your professor's comment is about reporting an **actual classifier result**, which means showing the performance at a *specific operating point*, not just the potential performance.

1.  **Fairer Comparison:** Reporting the ROC-AUC for all models helps you select the best *ranking* model. However, to compare their true *classification* utility, you should choose a single, fixed threshold (e.g., $0.5$) and report the Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and F1-Score for **every model** at that threshold.
2.  **Addressing the Plateau:** Your notebooks show that Logistic Regression and SVM plateaued around **AUC 0.906**. By adding their Confusion Matrices, you can visually show *where* they were failing (likely high False Negatives on the minority class), which directly justifies the switch to XGBoost and the use of the `scale_pos_weight` parameter.
3.  **Proving the Impact of Weighting:** You used class weighting in the Logistic Regression and SVM notebooks as well (e.g., `balanced` variant). You need to show that this weighting made a practical difference in the confusion matrix (fewer False Negatives) for those models, even if their overall AUC didn't improve much.

## 🛠️ Required Changes for Each Notebook

You need to verify or add the **Confusion Matrix** and final **Classification Report** for the best variant of each model, all operating at a specific, fixed threshold.

| Notebook File | Model(s) to Check | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`02_logistic_analysis.pdf`** | Baseline & Balanced LR | **Confirm:** The classification report is present (it is, and shows the F1-Score). **Add:** A separate block to explicitly display the **Confusion Matrix** for the **Baseline** model and the **Balanced** model. This visually proves where the linear model failed. |
| **`03_svm_analysis.pdf`** | Baseline & Balanced SVM | **Confirm:** The classification report is present. **Add:** A block to explicitly display the **Confusion Matrix** for the **Baseline** and **Balanced** SVM models. Show that the pattern of error is similar to Logistic Regression. |
| **`04_xgboost_analysis.pdf`** | Final Tuned XGBoost | **Most Critical:** After finding your final best model, ensure you: **1.** State the chosen **optimal threshold** (it won't be $0.5$). **2.** Convert probabilities to predictions using that threshold. **3.** Display the **Confusion Matrix** using these final predictions. |

By performing these checks across all notebooks, your presentation will transition smoothly from:
1.  *Baseline Model Potential* (LR/SVM AUC)
2.  *Baseline Model Actual Failure* (LR/SVM Confusion Matrix showing many False Negatives)
3.  *Final Model Potential* (XGBoost AUC)
4.  *Final Model Actual Success* (XGBoost Confusion Matrix showing high True Positives at the optimal threshold)
